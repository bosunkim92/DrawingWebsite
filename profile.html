        <h2>Nice to meet you,</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Rachel Kim
            <br>
            I am currently working on making this webpage to add to my portfolio. As you can 
            tell by the theme of this website, I love drawing and painting especially the things
            that I believe are important in my life. I am a baby coder so I only know how to use 
            HTML and CSS for now, but I'm looking forward to expend my knowledge in JavaScript, PHP,
            Phython and more in the future.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for taking your time to visit my webpage,
            hopefully you enjoy my drawings, or give me the feedback if you have any comments!
        </p>
